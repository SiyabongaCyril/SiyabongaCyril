### Greetings there, I'm Siyabonga Ntshingila.

I am a software developer with a background in Electrical Engineering. Passionate about solving real-world problems through software solutions, I transitioned from my studies to pursue a career in software development. Experienced with C++ and currently focusing on Flutter with Dart for mobile development. I aim to be a software developer that strives in solving a task at hand, no matter the technology I have to use, as long as I have mastered the core principles. 

Here's what I'm currently up to:
- Constantly learning and growing in the field of software development.
- Exposing myself to intuitive **UI/UX** designing for my applications.
- Exploring **Wordpress** through Ecommerce. 
- Working as a **Digital Developer Intern** @[Siyakha Consulting](https://siyakha.co.za/)
- Enjoy collaborating on diverse projects and am willing to contribute to the development community.
- Actively seeking opportunities in software development to apply and expand my skillset.

Feel free to reach out and connect with me.
